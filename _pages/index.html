                        <p>I bought the cutest cookie stamp for only $2 at Kmart today. Feeling pretty inspired to bake some biscuits and use my new label, the first dilemma became apparent–what kind of biscuits would allow for the stamp to be seen? Chocolate chip cookies were a no go zone (unfortunately), perhaps short bread? Then I remembered back to high school when I made Gingernut cookies inspired by Athenian coins (I really enjoyed Ancient History…) and had the ancient owl imprinted onto it – they came out perfectly and the owl kept its shape.</p>

                        <p>I recently stumbled upon a Paul Hollywood Gingernut Biscuit recipe and thought this was the perfect chance to try it out. The ingredients are simple and I found them all in my pantry:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>340 grams plain flour</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon bicarbonate soda</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
                            <li>100 grams butter</li>
                            <li>160 grams light brown sugar</li>
                            <li>4 tablespoons golden syrup</li>
                            <li>1 large beaten egg</li>
                            <li>And I personally added:</li>
                            <li>½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>A handful of crystallised ginger (read my additional notes!)</li>
                        </ul>
